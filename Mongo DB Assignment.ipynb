    "## Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "### Answer:-\n",
    "### MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible and dynamic JSON-like documents. It is designed for scalability, high availability, and high performance. MongoDB allows developers to store and retrieve data using flexible schema models that can be easily modified as business needs change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not follow the traditional relational database model of tables, rows, and columns. Instead, NoSQL databases store data in a more flexible, dynamic, and scalable format, such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and can be highly scalable and distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where data is unstructured or semi-structured, or when the data model is likely to change frequently. MongoDB's flexible document-based data model allows for easy schema changes without the need for downtime or complex migrations. Additionally, MongoDB's horizontal scalability and ability to distribute data across multiple nodes make it ideal for handling large volumes of data and high traffic workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB is commonly used in scenarios such as content management systems, e-commerce applications, mobile applications, and real-time analytics, where data is unstructured or semi-structured and needs to be analyzed and queried in real-time. However, it's important to note that SQL databases are still a better fit for scenarios where data is highly structured and requires complex joins or transactions."

    "## Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "### Answer:-\n",
    "### MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers a range of features that make it a versatile and scalable solution for storing and managing data. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document-Oriented Data Model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which allows for flexible and dynamic data structures. Data is stored in BSON format (Binary JSON), which can include nested documents, arrays, and other complex data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability and Performance: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data and high-traffic workloads. It can scale horizontally across multiple nodes and distribute data across multiple servers. MongoDB also supports in-memory storage and provides features such as sharding and replication to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and Querying: MongoDB supports a wide range of indexing and querying options, including full-text search, geospatial queries, and aggregation pipelines. It also provides a flexible query language and supports ad-hoc queries that can be executed in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High Availability and Fault Tolerance: MongoDB provides features such as replica sets and automatic failover to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Replica sets allow data to be replicated across multiple nodes, while automatic failover ensures that the system can quickly recover from failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security: MongoDB provides several security features, including authentication, encryption, and role-based access control. It also supports auditing and provides detailed logging to help monitor and track access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema-less Design: MongoDB's schema-less design allows for easy and flexible data modeling, enabling developers to easily modify and evolve their data models as business needs change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Platform Support: MongoDB supports multiple platforms and programming languages, including Java, Python, Node.js, and .NET. It also provides drivers for popular languages and platforms, making it easy to integrate with existing applications."

    "## Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Here's a brief explanation of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### delete_one(filter, collation=None, hint=None): This method removes a single document from the collection that matches the specified filter criteria. If multiple documents match the criteria, only the first document encountered in the collection is deleted. If no documents match the criteria, the method does nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### delete_many(filter, collation=None, hint=None): This method removes all documents from the collection that match the specified filter criteria. If no documents match the criteria, the method does nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### drop(cascade=False): This method drops the entire collection from the database, effectively deleting all the documents in the collection. If the cascade parameter is set to True, then all indexes associated with the collection are also dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### These methods are useful when we need to remove one or more documents from a collection or drop an entire collection. For example, we may want to delete a specific document from a collection if it no longer serves a purpose or if it contains incorrect data. We may also want to delete multiple documents that meet a certain criteria, such as documents that are older than a certain date or have a certain status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The drop() method can be used when we want to delete an entire collection, such as when we no longer need the data or when we want to start fresh with a new collection. However, it's important to use caution when using the drop() method, as it will permanently delete all the data in the collection and cannot be undone. It's recommended to take a backup of the collection before dropping it.\n"
